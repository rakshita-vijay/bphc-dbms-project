## 4. Design Philosophy & Highlights

- ### **Entity-Centric Architecture**
  The system revolves around six core entities that mirror real-world healthcare operations:
  
  - **üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Entity** - Healthcare professionals with specialized expertise
    - Unique identification through Aadhar ID
    - Specialization tracking (Cardiology, Neurology, Pediatrics, etc.)
    - Experience quantification for better patient-doctor matching
  
  - **üè• Patient Entity** - The heart of the healthcare system
    - Comprehensive demographic information
    - Mandatory primary physician assignment ensuring continuity of care
    - Address and age tracking for demographic analysis
  
  - **üè¢ Pharmaceutical Company Entity** - Drug manufacturers and suppliers
    - Company name serves as natural primary key
    - Contact information for business communications
    - Foundation for drug supply chain management
  
  - **üíä Drugs Entity** - Medication catalog with company associations
    - Composite primary key ensuring trade name uniqueness within companies
    - Chemical formula storage for pharmaceutical reference
    - Flexible design allowing same generic drugs from different manufacturers
  
  - **üè™ Pharmacy Entity** - Physical pharmacy locations
    - Complete contact and location information
    - Foundation for inventory and sales management
    - Contract management capabilities
  
  - **üìã Prescription Entity** - The critical link between doctors, patients, and medications
    - Temporal tracking with prescription dates
    - Support for multiple drugs per prescription
    - Quantity specification for precise medication management

- ### **Relationship Design**

  The system implements sophisticated relationship modeling that captures real-world complexities:
  
  - **Primary Physician Relationship** - Every patient has exactly one primary physician, but doctors can serve multiple patients, ensuring accountability while allowing workload distribution.
  
  - **Prescription Flexibility** - The many-to-many relationship between prescriptions and drugs is elegantly handled through the `Drug_Presc` junction table, allowing doctors to prescribe multiple medications with specific quantities.
  
  - **Pharmacy-Drug Marketplace** - The `Sells` relationship creates a flexible marketplace where the same drug can be sold at different pharmacies with varying prices, reflecting real market dynamics.
  
  - **Contract Management** - Pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies are connected through formal contracts with supervisors, dates, and content tracking, enabling proper business relationship management.

## 5. Schema Formation & Structure

- ### **Normalization**
  The database achieves **Third Normal Form (3NF)** through careful decomposition:
  
  - **First Normal Form**: All attributes contain atomic values
  - **Second Normal Form**: Elimination of partial dependencies through proper primary key design
  - **Third Normal Form**: Removal of transitive dependencies, particularly in the prescription-drug relationship

- ### **Primary Key Strategy**
  The system employs both simple and composite primary keys strategically:
  - **Simple Keys**: Natural identifiers like Aadhar IDs and company names
  - **Composite Keys**: Complex relationships like `(Doctor, Patient, PrescriptionDate)` ensuring temporal uniqueness

- ### **Foreign Key Integrity**
  Comprehensive referential integrity through carefully designed foreign key constraints that maintain data consistency while allowing business flexibility.

## 6. Functionalities & Features

- ### **Core CRUD Operations**
  Every entity supports full **Create, Read, Update, Delete** operations through dedicated stored procedures:
  
  ```sql
  -- Example: Adding a new doctor with validation
  CALL AddDoctor(1001, 'Dr. Meera Rao', 'Cardiology', 15);
  ```

- ### **Advanced Query Capabilities**

  - **üìä Prescription Analytics**
    - `GetPrescriptionReport()`: Generate comprehensive prescription reports for patients within date ranges
    - `GetPrescriptionDetails()`: Retrieve specific prescription information for a given patient and date
  
  - **üè• Inventory Management**
    - `GetPharmacyStock()`: Complete inventory listing with supplier and pricing information
    - Real-time stock position tracking across multiple pharmacy locations
  
  - **üë• Relationship Queries**
    - `GetPatientsForDoctor()`: Patient roster management for healthcare professionals
    - `GetPharmacyCompanyContact()`: Business relationship and contact information retrieval

- ### **Business Intelligence Features**

  - **Drug Analysis by Company**: Complete pharmaceutical portfolio analysis showing all medications produced by specific manufacturers, essential for procurement and partnership decisions.
  
  - **Contact Management System**: Integrated communication system linking pharmacies with their pharmaceutical partners, including supervisor assignments and contract details.
